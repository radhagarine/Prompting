Security::
Authentication: Use JWT tokens with short expiration (e.g., 24 hours) and refresh tokens.
Authorization: Implement role-based access control (user vs. admin).
Data Protection:
Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., document content) at rest using PostgreSQL’s encryption features.
Use HTTPS for all communications.

Rate Limiting:
Apply rate limits to API endpoints (e.g., 100 requests/minute per user).
Use FastAPI middleware for rate limiting.

Input Sanitization:
Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
Use libraries like DOMPurify for client-side sanitization and sqlalchemy for parameterized queries.

Monitoring:
Integrate Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.
Use PostHog for usage analytics (e.g., document generation frequency, feature adoption).

Code Quality::

Standards:
Follow PEP 8 for Python and ESLint for JavaScript/React.
Use TypeScript for React components to catch type errors early.

Testing:
Write unit tests for backend (pytest) and frontend (Jest/React Testing Library).
Cover critical paths: document generation, payment processing, authentication.
Achieve at least 80% test coverage.

CI/CD:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
Run linting, tests, and security scans on every commit.

Documentation:
Generate API documentation using FastAPI’s OpenAPI integration.
Maintain a README with setup instructions, architecture overview, and deployment steps.


Non-Functional Requirements::

Performance:
Document generation should complete in <2 seconds for typical inputs.
API response time should be <200ms for 95% of requests.


Scalability:
Support up to 1,000 concurrent users in v1.
Use database indexing and caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.


Reliability:
Achieve 99.9% uptime.
Implement retry mechanisms for external services (e.g., Stripe, WeasyPrint).


Maintainability:
Organize code into modular components (e.g., separate concerns for auth, document generation, payments).
Use consistent naming conventions and clear comments.
